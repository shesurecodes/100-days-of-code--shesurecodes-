My 100 Days of Code challenge with Python. Daily coding, projects, notes, and progress logs - improving one line of code at a time.
# 100 Days of Code — Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!  
This repository documents my daily progress as I work through [*The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by **Dr. Angela Yu**.  
Each day, I’ll be learning new Python concepts, building projects, and strengthening my skills — one day, one project at a time.

## 🚀 About the Challenge

The **100 Days of Code** challenge is a commitment to code **every day for 100 days** and share my progress publicly.  
Through this bootcamp, I’ll gain hands-on experience with Python programming — from the fundamentals to advanced topics like APIs, web development, automation, data analysis, and game design.
